Travel Itinerary App (React JS)
The Travel Itinerary App is a well-structured, responsive app designed to help users organize their travel schedules based on their destination, dates, and number of people. The app provides an intuitive UI that lets users easily input their travel details and view relevant information.

Key Features:

Destination-Based Residence Listings: Users enter their travel destination, and the app displays available residences such as hotels and lodges in that area.

Travel Details Input: Users input details like destination, travel dates, and the number of people in their group.

Light and Dark Mode: The app supports a toggle between light and dark mode for a personalized user experience.

Error Handling: If the user enters incorrect or incomplete details, the app shows error messages to guide them toward providing the correct information.

App Flow:

Users enter their destination, travel dates, and number of people.

The app verifies the details and displays appropriate residences based on the destination.

If the details are incorrect, error messages are shown to the user.

Challenges Faced:

One of the key challenges was finding a reliable hotel API. To overcome this, I created a local API to provide hotel data and ensure smooth functionality.

As per the project requirements, I focused primarily on UI implementation and spent less time on integrating a backend.

This app is built entirely with React JS and does not have a real backend. It emphasizes creating a seamless and responsive user interface while managing the core functionality with local API data.
